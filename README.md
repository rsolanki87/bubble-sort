# bubble-sort
<h1>Project Purpose</h1>
<p>Build a program that performs a bubble sort algorithm, which takes an unsorted array and then sorts it from the lowest values to the highest values.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Built a bubble_sort method that implements this specific algorithm and returns an unsorted array to a sorted array.  Also, implemented a check named "swapped" that determines if the array has already been sorted and if it has, the program will skip the sorted array.</p>
